    Hi, I'm Sally. Thanks for checking out my portfolio. 
    Above you'll find links to different types of work I've done. 
    I'm an early career data analyst with a passion for data wrangling ðŸ¤  in order to allow data to live its best life. 
    I also enjoy problem solving and the endorphin hit that comes with debugging a particularly stubborn challenge. 
    Feel free to <a href="mailto:sallyeheinzel@gmail.com">reach out</a> to me if you have any questions or comments.
