author-bio: Hi, I'm Sally. Thanks for checking out my portfolio. Above you'll find links to different types of work I've done. I'm an early career data analyst with a passion for data wrangling ü§† in order to allow data to live its best life. I also enjoy problem solving and the endorphin hit that comes with debugging a particularly stubborn challenge. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:sallyeheinzel@gmail.com) to me if you have any questions or comments.    # change to false to hide
